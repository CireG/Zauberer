= Zauberer 

_Zauberer_ is a project for creating an IWAD that can run all Hexen PWADs out there. In order to play this, a source port capable of running Hexen, is required.

Although the Doom engine source code is free to to the public, the IWAD required to play on the engine, is not. _Zauberer_ aims to provide you a free-content IWAD at your disposal. The GPL licensed source code mixed with non-commercial assets creates a completely free Hexen alternative. Zauberer uses the ISC license, which can be seen in the file "LICENSE".

== Launching Zauberer
In order to load this IWAD, a source port is required, of which a list is available on the
http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port[Doom Wiki]. Pick one that can load Hexen!

On Windows, you should place _Zauberer_'s data file (the file ending with +.wad+) alongside the engine (eg, +zdoom.exe+).  On Unix-like
systems, these data files should go in either +/usr/share/games/doom+
or your home directory.

Most likely, the source port you chose is already capable of running _Zauberer_ without extra hassle. 

=== Assets

For simplicity's sake, just make sure whatever you wish to submit to the project is original/not based on something else, at least.

=== Levels

Maps should stay in "Hexen" format, obviously.

Before you submit, ask yourself these questions:

 * Is the map balanced for this map slot?
 * Are all player starts functional?
 * Are there any special tricks being used, that could potentially break the map in various source ports?
 * Did I test this map thoroughly?
 * Is too complex or too simple?
 * Is it fun for the average player?

=== Graphics

Graphics should try to stay the same size and color as Hexen, but the theme can be changed. But keep it appropiate.

=== Feedback on assets

The best way to answer this question is to ask the community in various ways. 
Here are some of the typical ways of doing so:

_Option 1_
 : Post your work on https://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/72519-zauberer/[the official Zauberer thread] at Doomworld.

_Option 2_
 : Directly send a pull request of your submission here. 

_Option 3_
 : Email CireG or someone you know that can give good feedback.

_Option 4_
 : IRC, such as #zdoom, #zandronum, #freedoom, etc 

=== Documenting
Zauberer could use some documents, such as credits and addinf to the http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Zauberer[Zauberer page at Doom Wiki].
