Zauberer aims to be a free as in freedom replacement for the proprietary Hexen game data. 
The proposed theme is a mash up of Steam/Cyberpunk and religious mythologies. The game is supposed to take place after the story. The game is in early development at the moment.
Useage with ZDoom-based engines is recommended at the moment. Compiling instructions here: http://zdoom.org/wiki/Main_Page
Use a WAD editor like SLADE for editing the WAD: http://slade.mancubus.net/
