Zauberer aims to be a free as in freedom replacement for the proprietary Hexen game data. 
The proposed theme is Egyptian mythology. The game is supposed to take place after the story. The game is in early development at the moment.
Useage with ZDoom-based engines is recommended at the moment. Compiling instructions here: http://zdoom.org/wiki/Main_Page
Use a WAD editor like SLADE for editing the WAD: http://slade.mancubus.net/

NOTE: Because of problems with GitHub and my personal life, I have been unable to upload the current version of Zauberer.
I'll try to solve this within the next week, but I can't make any promises.
